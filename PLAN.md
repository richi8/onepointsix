# onepointsix — Game Plan

A realistic, browser-based **extraction shooter** on shareable islands. Click a link and you're
playing in seconds: no install, no account. Written fully in TypeScript.

## Vision

- **Genre:** extraction shooter with 3–10 minute runs.
- **Tone:** grounded realistic, with PBR materials and real-world weapons feel. Think Arma
  Reforger at low settings, not photoreal.
- **Instant access:** open the page, press **Play**, and you're in. No account; identity is an
  anonymous token.
- **Default world:** there is always a default island. **Play** drops you into the first game on
  it that isn't full.
- **Shareable worlds:** a world is fully described by its config (seed and settings), so a link
  *is* the world. "Beat my score on this island."
- **Fresh start every run:** no persistent progression. Each run is scored on its own.
- **Local first:** the game runs entirely in the browser with no backend. Multiplayer is a future
  feature, but the architecture is ready for it from day one.

## Entry Flow

1. Load the page and see the main menu with a **Play** button. The default world renders behind
   it.
2. **Play** starts a quick join into the first game on the default world that isn't full.
   - **Now (local):** there is only one local game, so it starts immediately.
   - **Future (multiplayer):** matchmaking picks the first instance with a free slot and creates a
     new instance if all are full.
3. A world link (`?world=...`) skips the default world and joins that world instead.

## Game Modes

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| **PvE (solo)** | You versus AI on your own island. Played just for fun. |
| **Mixed** | Other operators share the island with you. Locally they are all bots. In future multiplayer, bots fill empty slots and are removed as humans join. |

### World capacity

The island is 800 × 800 m, with 6 outposts.

| Kind | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Operators** (players and fill bots) | **8** per game | Mixed mode: every slot starts as a bot, and humans replace them in the future. PvE: only you. |
| **Guards** (world AI) | ~24 | About 3 per outpost, plus patrols. Present in both modes. |

**Why 8:** that's roughly 80,000 m² per operator, which is about a 280 m square each. Runs are
3–10 minutes, and the aim is to meet another operator every 1–3 minutes, while guards fill the
time in between. The plan started at 12, but chunk 12's bot playtest found that at 12 an operator
spotted another every 42 s, 8 every 57 s and 6 every 97 s, so 8 is the middle ground until human
playtests say otherwise. The cap is a single constant (`OPERATOR_CAPACITY`).

## Core Loop

1. **Drop in** at any time at an insertion point on the island. Your personal run clock starts.
2. **Receive contracts.** You get 1–2 objectives per run, for example: grab intel from the radio
   tower, destroy a supply cache, eliminate a bot commander.
3. **Loot, fight, sneak.** Search containers, fight AI patrols (and players in Mixed mode), and
   manage noise and weight.
4. **Extract.** Reach an extraction point that is currently open. Some extraction points need you
   to call and hold for about 20 seconds while bots converge on you.
5. **Score.** The extracted loot value, kills and completed contracts make your run score. It
   goes on the world's leaderboard.
   - **Die = score 0.**
   - **Run clock hits 10:00 = MIA = score 0.**

## Features & Design Pillars

### Movement (grounded, no grapple)
- Sprint with stamina, crouch, jump
- Mantle over walls and crates
- Lean left and right (Q/E), which pairs with destructible cover
- **Carry weight.** Heavy loot slows you down and disables mantling, so loot and movement
  work against each other.

### Gunplay
- **Proof of concept roster (3 weapons):**
  - **Assault rifle:** all-rounder, full-auto
  - **Pistol:** sidearm, always carried
  - **Bolt-action rifle:** long range for the open island, high damage, slow
- Hitscan with recoil patterns, spread (depending on movement and stance) and hitboxes (headshots)
- Ammo and reloading, suppressors as loot
- Grenades

### Destructible cover
- Walls, fences and crates are built from a few **breakable panels**, each with its own HP. No
  voxels.
- Breaking a panel is a small network event ("panel 812 broke"), so it's cheap to sync.
- Debris and collision update in real time.

### Noise system
- Gunfire, explosions, sprinting and breaking cover make noise events that bots hear and
  investigate.
- You choose between stealth and going loud. Suppressors reduce the noise radius.

### Extraction pressure
- A personal run clock for each player, which fits drop-in play
- Extraction points open and close at random
- Call-and-hold extractions draw in bots

### Bots (AI operators)
- They send the **same input commands as players**, so bot fill in Mixed mode comes for free.
- States: patrol, investigate, engage, take cover, flank
- Perception through sight and hearing (the noise system)
- Difficulty levels, and special "commander" bots used as contract targets

### Shareable worlds and leaderboards
- The world config (seed and settings) is encoded in the URL.
- Each world has its own leaderboard: stored locally first, on the server once there is
  multiplayer.
- A share button on the results screen.

### Replays (cheap because the simulation is deterministic)
- The simulation runs on inputs, so a run can be recorded as its inputs.
- Death cam first, shareable replay links later.

## Technical Architecture

**Stack:** TypeScript, Vite, Three.js (client), Web Worker (local game server). No backend for
now. In future multiplayer, the same server code runs in Node.

```
src/
  shared/   deterministic simulation: world gen, collision, movement, weapons, protocol types
  server/   authoritative game server: tick loop, bots, loot, contracts, extraction, scoring
  client/   rendering, input, prediction/reconciliation, interpolation, HUD, audio
```

### Rules that keep multiplayer easy to add later
1. **Server-authoritative from day one.** The server runs in a **Web Worker**. Only serializable
   messages cross the worker boundary, which acts as the network. Later the same server code runs
   in Node unchanged.
2. **Shared simulation.** Movement, weapons and collision are identical on client and server. The
   client predicts; the server corrects.
3. **Bots are just players without a keyboard.** They produce input commands the same way players
   do.
4. **The local transport can simulate lag and packet loss,** so netcode bugs show up while
   playing offline.
5. **A world is its config.** Only the seed and settings travel over the network; every peer
   generates the same world.
6. **Fixed-timestep, deterministic simulation.** This makes prediction, lag compensation and
   replays possible.

### Assets
- Poly Haven for PBR textures and HDRIs, Quaternius for animated characters and guns, glTF for
  models
- Budget for small downloads: KTX2 textures, meshopt-compressed glTF and level of detail (LOD)

## Implementation Roadmap

Each chunk ends in something you can play or test. **Chunks 0–6 are the proof of concept.**
Everything runs locally in the browser; there is no backend. The **Status** column says whether
a chunk is **Done** (committed), **Partly done** (committed, with part of its goal waiting on
something outside the code) or **Not started**.

| # | Chunk | Scope | Done when | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Foundations** | Vite + TS setup, `shared/server/client` layout, local server in a Worker, message protocol types, fixed tick loop, fake-lag/loss toggle | A box moves when you press keys, driven by the server | **Done** |
| 1 | **World and menu** | Seeded island terrain, outposts, props, trees and rocks; renderer, sky, fog; collision; **default world**; main menu with **Play** over the rendered island; `?world=` param | Load the page, press Play, and you're on the default island; the same seed gives the same island | **Done** |
| 2 | **Movement** | Pointer lock, CS-like movement, sprint, crouch, jump; client prediction and reconciliation against the Worker server | Movement feels tight even with 100 ms fake lag | **Done** |
| 3 | **Advanced movement** | Slide, mantle, lean, stamina, carry-weight hooks | You can mantle a crate and slide into cover | **Done** (the slide was removed after chunk 14) |
| 4 | **Gunplay** | The 3 weapons (assault rifle, pistol, bolt-action), weapon switching, hitscan, recoil and spread, hitboxes, ammo and reload, damage and death, HUD, hit markers; lag-compensation scaffolding | You can shoot target dummies with a satisfying feel | **Done** |
| 5 | **Bots** | Navigation grid, perception (sight and hearing), state machine (patrol, investigate, engage, cover, flank), difficulty levels; **guards** at outposts and **fill-bot operators** that play runs like a player | Guards defend outposts; operator bots loot and extract | **Done** |
| 6 | **Run loop** | Quick join through the local "game directory" (first game not full, capped at 12 operators), PvE and Mixed modes, drop-in insertion, run clock and MIA, loot containers, inventory and weight, extraction points opening and closing, call-and-hold extraction, results screen and score | **The full PvE and Mixed loop is playable. First real playtest.** | **Done** |
| 7 | **Destructible cover** | Panel-based walls, fences and crates with HP, debris, collision updates, destruction events, grenades | You can blow a hole in a wall and shoot through it | **Done** |
| 8 | **Contracts and noise** | Objectives per run (intel, cache, commander), noise events that attract bots, suppressors | Runs feel different from each other | **Done** |
| 9 | **Look and sound** | Realistic assets (glTF, PBR, animations), positional audio, footsteps, muzzle flash, performance pass | It looks and sounds like a real game | **Done** |
| 10 | **Shareable worlds** | World config and sharer name + score in the URL, per-world local leaderboard, share button, static hosting, death cam from recorded inputs | You send a link and a friend gets the same island with your score to beat | **Done** |

### Phase 2: polish and depth (still local only)

Chunks 11–18 finish the single-browser game. Multiplayer stays in **Future**, and none of these
chunks may break the rules that keep multiplayer easy to add later. Each chunk also resolves
the Known Issues named in its scope.

| # | Chunk | Scope | Done when | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | **Ship and load** | Verify GitHub Pages end to end (the live site, share links, `?world=`); a loading screen with progress instead of the flat-colour swap; KTX2 textures and meshopt glTF; code splitting so the first bundle is under 500 kB; build the texture arrays off the main thread (`createImageBitmap` / a Worker); replace the Mixamo soldier with a CC0 character (e.g. Quaternius); generate the texture layer list from one source | A stranger opens the live link on a mid-range laptop and is playing within about 5 s on a warm cache; no licensing doubts left | **Done** |
| 12 | **Playtest and tuning** | A local run-stats log (length, cause of death, extraction used, contracts done, loot value) with a debug panel to read it; tune the operator cap, guard count, bot difficulty, weapon damage and recoil, extraction timings and loot values from playtests; fix what playtests find; mode-less links; the menu at small window sizes | Several full runs by other people; the average run lands in 3–10 minutes, and no single strategy dominates | **Partly done**: the run log, bot playtest, bot and cap tuning, mode-less links and small-window menu are in; runs by other people haven't happened yet |
| 13 | **Animation** | Death animation with a simple ragdoll that doesn't sink into ground or walls; third-person crouch-walk, slide, mantle, jump and fall clips; third-person reload, weapon switch and grenade throw; suppressors on third-person guns; first-person arms with animated reloads; a distinct look for commanders and each side; hit flash only where the round landed; the body lean matches the lean hitbox | Watching another operator, you can tell what they are doing: crouching, sliding, reloading, throwing | **Done** |
| 14 | **Sound** | Recorded CC0 samples replace synthesized ones (a new source, e.g. Freesound CC0, checked per file); occlusion and simple reverb from walls and buildings; ambient wind, sea, birds and distant fighting; footstep surfaces read from the painted terrain; a sliding scrape; pooled panner nodes | With eyes closed you can tell the direction, distance and whether a wall is in between | **Done** |
| 15 | **World detail** | Buildings with doors, windows and simple interiors built from breakable panels; ground cover (grass, bushes, small rocks) near the player; tree LOD, impostors and sway; water with waves, shoreline foam and an underwater effect; debris textured like its panel; cascaded shadows; terrain LOD; adaptive resolution checked on slow hardware | Outposts can be fought through room by room, and the island looks alive at 60 fps on a mid-range laptop | **Done** (60 fps checked on an M3 Pro only, and slow hardware only simulated) |
| 16 | **Day/night and weather** | Time of day and weather become part of the world config (and so the link); lighting, sky and fog follow them; night brings more and tougher guards but better loot; flashlights (visible to bots, so a noise-like trade-off); rain and fog shorten sight and mask noise in bot perception; leaderboards are kept per condition | The same island plays differently at noon, at night and in fog, and a link reproduces the exact conditions | Not started |
| 17 | **Full-run replays** | Record the whole run as inputs plus periodic keyframes (extending the death cam tape); keep cover-state history so replays show panels breaking at the right time; a replay viewer with scrubbing, speed control and a free camera; export and import a compact replay file (no backend, so it's shared as a file); a HUD in the death cam | You finish a run, save the replay, send the file, and a friend watches it exactly as it happened | Not started |
| 18 | **Rivals** | Operator bot personalities: the *rat* (sneaks, loots, avoids fights), the *hunter* (follows gunfire to find wounded operators), the *camper* (waits near extraction points) and the *looter* (goes for high-value crates); third-partying, so operators are drawn to fights between others; a bounty on the operator carrying the most value, who is marked or heard more easily; a kill feed; bags left by bodies show their value before you open them. Personalities carry over as fill bots in future multiplayer | In Mixed mode, meeting another operator plays out differently depending on who they are, and a big haul makes you feel hunted | Not started |

## Known Issues

Shortcomings of what has been built so far, to improve later. Every chunk adds the gaps it
leaves here. Each item notes the chunk it came from. Fixed items stay in the list: they are
marked **Resolved** with the chunk or commit that fixed them and how.

### Look and animation
- **No death animation or ragdoll** (9). Bodies topple backward stiffly around their feet and
  can sink into the ground or walls.
  **Resolved** (13): the soldier's death clip plays, and the body lies down away from its killer.
  Before it falls, rays at knee and waist height check for room, and for the flung arms either
  side. If there isn't enough room it turns up to 180° and slides back off a wall. Once down, it
  tilts to the slope under it and lifts until its head, chest, hips, hands, feet, knees and pack
  clear the ground. It isn't a physics ragdoll (see below).
- **Third-person movement has no animations beyond idle, walk and run** (9). Crouch-walking is
  a bent walk posed in code. Sliding, mantling, jumping and falling still play the walk or run
  clip.
  **Resolved** (13): snapshots now say whether a body is on the ground, in the air, sliding or
  mantling. Each state has its own stance posed in code: foot targets reached with leg IK and a
  bend at the waist, blended in and out at 12 per second. There are still no clips for them
  (see below).
- **Actions aren't animated in third person** (9). Reloading, switching weapons and throwing
  grenades don't show on other players.
  **Resolved** (13): snapshots carry the action (reload, draw, throw) and how far through it is.
  A reload tips the gun while the left hand goes down to a belt pouch and back to the magazine
  well; a switch brings the gun up from low; a throw lowers the gun while the left hand cocks a
  grenade over the shoulder and throws. The server tells a throw from a switch with a flag of
  its own, since both only set `draw`.
- **Third-person guns don't show suppressors** (9), although the viewmodel does.
  **Resolved** (13): snapshots carry whether the weapon in hand is suppressed. The can is drawn,
  and muzzle flashes and tracers start from its end.
- **Distant bodies animate at 12 Hz and skip hand IK** (9), beyond 90 m. It's cheaper, but
  scoped players may notice the stutter.
- **One soldier model for every side, told apart only by tint** (9). Commanders look like any
  other guard. Since chunk 11 only the uniform is recoloured, not the whole body.
  **Resolved in part** (13): it's still one model, but the sides now differ in kit as well as
  uniform. Operators carry a pack and bedroll with black webbing, and guards wear brown webbing.
  Commanders (flagged in snapshots) wear a paler uniform, a red band round the helmet and a radio
  with a mast on their back.
- **The hit flash lights the whole body** (9), not just where the round landed.
  **Resolved** (13): the soldier's materials glow round the point the round landed, fading out
  over 30 cm. The point is kept in the body's own space, so the glow moves with it.
- **The body lean is only an approximation of the lean hitbox** (9). The head ends up roughly
  over its hit sphere, but not exactly.
  **Resolved** (13): a lean now shifts the hips 14 cm out over planted feet, then rolls the upper
  body by a Newton step until the middle of the head is exactly as far to the side as the head
  hitbox. Checked by drawing the hitbox over the body. The head still sits a few centimetres
  lower than its hitbox at full lean (see below).
- **First-person hands are boxes** (9), with no arms or animated reload.
  **Resolved** (13): first person now draws the soldier's own arms, cut from the model by skin
  weights, and reaches both hands to the gun with IK and closed fingers. The left hand goes down
  for a magazine on a reload and throws the grenades.
- **Buildings are still boxes** (9): the walls, watchtowers, containers and crates are textured,
  but the geometry is primitive. There are no doors, windows or interiors.
  **Resolved in part** (15): every outpost has a two-room concrete building (see below). Its walls
  are breakable panels with doorways and window openings, and lintels over each opening rest on
  the columns either side. Corner posts hold up an unbreakable roof, and there's a table and a
  guarded crate in each room. Everything is still built from boxes, and the watchtowers and
  containers are unchanged.
- **Trees are procedural** (9), because Poly Haven's tree models are hundreds of MB each. They
  have no LOD or impostors, and they don't sway.
  **Resolved in part** (15): trees are split into 100 m tiles. Tiles within 170–190 m of the
  camera draw every tree in full, and their crowns sway in one wind. Farther tiles draw each tree
  as an impostor: a card facing the camera, with a picture of the tree baked at startup. In the
  shadow pass the card faces the sun, so far trees still cast shadows. The trees are still
  procedural.
- **There is no ground cover** (9): no grass blades, bushes or small rocks near the player.
  **Resolved** (15): grass clumps (to 42 m), low bushes (to 75 m) and pebbles (to 35 m) are
  scattered round the camera. Each 8 m cell scatters them the same way every time, thickest where
  the ground is painted grass, and never on props, under roofs or in the sea. They shrink away
  toward the edge of their range, and the grass and bushes sway.
- **Water is a flat, see-through plane** (9), with no waves, reflections, shoreline foam or
  underwater effect.
  **Resolved in part** (15): a 240 m grid round the camera rolls with four wave trains, inside a
  flat ring out to the horizon. The sea's depth comes from a height map of the island: shallow
  water is clear and pale, deep water dark, waves die down toward the shore and foam laps along
  it in bands. Below the surface the fog turns murky green. It reflects the sky through the
  environment map, but not the island (see below).
- **Debris is coloured with each layer's average** (9), not textured like the panel it came
  from.
  **Resolved** (15): debris uses the panel's texture layer and tint. Each chunk is textured in its
  own frame, so the texture tumbles with it instead of sliding through a world-space projection.
- **Shadows use one fixed 2048 px map** (9), with no cascades, so distant shadows are coarse or
  missing.
  **Resolved** (15): two cascades of 2048 px each, 32 m and 230 m round the player, blending over
  the near one's edge. three.js's CSM addon would have taken over every material's
  onBeforeCompile, so `src/client/cascades.ts` patches the stock lighting chunk instead: the
  second sun gives no light and only lends its shadow map. Bodies now cast shadows only within
  60 m. Before, every soldier on screen was drawn into the shadow map however far away it was.
- **The soldier is stylized, not realistic** (11). Quaternius's low-poly SWAT character was the
  best rigged and animated CC0 soldier available, but it doesn't match the grounded tone. Its
  helmet hides the face, and its hands stay open instead of gripping the gun.
  **Resolved in part** (13): the fingers now close round the grip and fore-end. The model is still
  stylized, and its helmet still hides the face.
- **Walk and run speeds are estimated** (11). The clips' natural speeds (1.3 and 3.2 m/s) were
  worked out from how far the feet travel, not watched in motion, so feet may slide a little.
  Sprinting plays the run clip up to 1.8× faster.
- **Crouch-walking looks like lunging** (11). The crouch drops the body and bends each leg with IK
  to where the walk clip puts the feet, and those feet are placed for standing height.
  **Resolved** (13): crouched, the feet the walk clip places are pulled in under the hips (strides
  45% shorter, lifted half as high and a little wider apart), so the legs stay folded under the
  body.
- **The soldier's other clips were dropped** (11) to save download size: death, shooting, hit
  reactions and rolls. Chunk 13 can bring back the death clip from the source file.
  **Resolved in part** (13): the death clip is back (4.5 kB). Shooting, hit reactions and rolls
  are still left out.

- **Deaths aren't a physics ragdoll** (13). Every body plays the same death clip, laid on the
  ground as above. Limbs can still pass through props, fences and other bodies, and a body never
  slides down a slope or reacts to a round beyond which way it falls. It only falls away from
  its killer if the kill event arrives before the snapshot that shows it dead, which it normally
  does.
- **The new stances are poses, not animations** (13). A slide, jump, fall and climb each hold a
  single pose of the legs, and a crouch-walk is the walk clip squashed. A hop shorter than about
  0.1 s barely shows. The source model has no clips for any of them.
  The slide pose went with the slide (after 14).
- **Every gun reloads the same way** (13), with a magazine change, even the bolt-action. The hand
  paths are keyframes and don't depend on the gun's model.
- **Hand grips were fitted by eye** (13), in a pose viewer, for the rifle and the pistol. The
  bolt-action uses the rifle's. The directions for the fingers and thumb are guesses tuned by
  screenshot.
  **Improved** (13, follow-up): the fingers curled so far that they came back over the top of
  the fore-end and showed above the gun. The curl is now gentler, the support hand sits under
  the fore-end with its fingers angled forward round the far side, the grip hand's thumb folds
  in, and the hands are drawn at 80%, since the model's gloves are oversized next to real guns.
  Checked from both sides and in first person for all three guns. The pistol still looks a
  little small in the fist.
- **First-person arms are stretched to reach** (13). The soldier's arms are too short for where the
  viewmodel holds the guns, so they're drawn 1.15× larger from shoulders placed where no real
  shoulder is (the left one far forward). Aiming the pistol, the forearms fill the bottom of the
  screen. The reload's hand movement mostly happens below the screen, so you mainly see the gun dip.
- **The grenade in hand is a plain sphere** (13), not a grenade model.
- **Only bodies that die on screen drop their gun** (13). A body that dies out of sight is drawn
  without one. The gun falls straight to the ground height where it lands, with no collision.
- **A leaning head sits a little low** (13). Side to side it's exactly over its hitbox, but at
  full lean it's a few centimetres below it, and a crouched head is a few centimetres off too.
- **The animation was checked by still screenshots** (13) of chosen moments in the new pose viewer
  (`dev/pose.html`), plus one screenshot of a real game in first person. Nobody has watched it
  moving at full speed in play, and its cost per frame with many bodies near wasn't measured.
  Each near body now also runs leg IK when crouched, sliding, airborne or leaning, and hand
  orientation and finger curl every update.

- **Doors are open doorways** (15). There are no door leaves to open or shut. Doorways are 2.2 m
  wide so a bot's path always fits through the 1 m nav grid. Windows are open holes with no glass.
- **One building plan for every outpost** (15): two rooms, a front door, an end door and a door
  between them. It varies only in size, the placement of its openings and which of four corners
  and turns it takes. There are no buildings outside the outposts.
- **Outposts were rearranged** (15). The building takes a corner, so the containers and crates
  landed elsewhere on every island. An older link or leaderboard score is for the old layout of
  the same island. Only the outposts' insides changed; terrain, trees, rocks, fences and
  extraction points didn't move.
- **The roof can't be broken** (15), though every wall can. With all the walls blown out, a
  roof is left standing on its four corner posts.
- **Indoor light is a flat cut** (15). Surfaces inside a building's walls and under its roof get
  30% of the sky's light, with a hard edge at the doorway. Light through doors and windows isn't
  modelled, and soldiers and debris inside aren't dimmed.
- **Ground cover is only for looks** (15). Nothing collides with grass, bushes or pebbles, and bots
  see straight through them, so bushes are kept under 0.9 m and grass under 0.6 m. Near the
  coast grass can stand on sand, because each tuft reads the paint at the nearest terrain vertex.
  **Resolved** (15, follow-up): bots can't see through bushes or thick grass. Bushes are
  scattered in `src/shared/vegetation.ts`, identically on the server and every client, and are now
  0.5–1.3 m and drawn to 120 m (bot sight reaches 120 m), so crouching behind a big one hides you
  while standing doesn't. Grass is modelled as a layer up to 0.6 m deep that a sight line loses 55%
  to per metre through thick grass, so it hides a body only where the line skims the ground near it.
  A bot sees someone if at least 30% of their chest or head shows; less than full view slows
  spotting, and an unsuppressed muzzle flash shows through leaves. Still open: grass isn't placed
  blade by blade for sight, so a lone tuft doesn't hide you and a gap in a field does; nothing
  collides with them; bullets go straight through; bots don't look for bushes to hide in. With no
  prone stance, a crouched chest (0.7 m) is above the tallest grass, so grass alone rarely hides
  anyone.
- **The tree impostors are rough** (15). There's one picture from the side, lit evenly and then
  darkened by a hand-set 0.4 to match the full trees. Trees switch between full and impostor at
  170–190 m with no cross-fade. A sun-facing card only approximates a crown's shadow, and
  swaying crowns cast still shadows.
- **The sea reflects only the sky** (15), through the environment map. There are no reflections
  of the island. Out past the rolling grid the waves are only in the normals. Far off, the sea
  looks pale, reflecting the bright horizon. The underwater effect is only fog: no muffling and no
  distortion. It can only be seen when the death camera sinks into the sea.
- **Shadows end at 230 m** (15), and bodies cast them only within 60 m. The cascade patch changes
  three.js's lighting chunk for every scene: any scene with exactly two shadow-casting directional
  lights is taken as cascades. It matches the chunk's text, and fails loudly if a three.js update
  changes it.
- **Far terrain doesn't carry what stands on it** (15). Trees, rocks and props sit on the exact
  ground, so on a coarse far tile they can float or sink a little.
- **The textured island looks washed out** (noticed in 15, from 11). The strong sky light
  (environment intensity 1.7) flattens the ground's colours and makes the sun's shadows faint.
  Checked against the build before chunk 15: it looked the same.
  **Resolved** (15, follow-up): the sun is up from 2.6 to 3.3 and the sky light down to 1.0
  (hemisphere 0.3), so the sunlit side outweighs the shade and shadows read; tone mapping is
  Khronos PBR Neutral at 0.9 exposure instead of ACES, which bleached greens toward yellow-grey;
  fog starts at 120 m instead of 60 m. Alpha-tested grass and bush cards had their alpha boosted
  by mip level, since distant ones were thinning into pale hollow outlines. Distant bushes still
  look a little blue-grey from the sky light on their up-facing normals.
- **World detail was checked by screenshots on one machine** (15). Headless Chrome on an M3 Pro
  holds 60 fps (median 16.7 ms, 95th percentile 18.2 ms) at 1280 × 720 in a Mixed game.
  Draw calls fell from 348 to 239 at the same spawn, and triangles rose from 639k to 736k. A
  mid-range laptop wasn't tried, nobody has watched the swaying and waves in motion, and the
  ground cover's rebuild, when the camera crosses an 8 m cell, wasn't timed.
### Sound
- **Every sound is still synthesized** (9), not recorded. The plan's CC0 asset sources have no
  audio, so recorded samples need a new source.
  **Resolved** (14): guns, the grenade, reloads, footsteps, breaking cover, landing, being
  hit and the ambience are 28 CC0 recordings from Freesound, listed in `src/client/soundlist.ts`.
  `scripts/fetch-sounds.mjs` checks each one's page says CC0, cuts it and packs them all into
  `sounds.m4a` (AAC, 105 s, 854 kB) with `sounds.json` saying where each sits. Footsteps are four
  footfalls per surface cut from walking recordings by loudness. The interface's beeps (hit marker,
  pickup, call, run end) are still synthesized on purpose.
- **Sound ignores walls** (9): there's no occlusion and no reverb, and footsteps can be heard
  through walls.
  **Resolved** (14): every sound out in the world casts a ray from the ear. If it's blocked it
  casts another 2.5 m higher at both ends: when that one's clear the sound is half muffled (it
  gets over a wall), and otherwise fully (a building or a hill). Muffled sounds are quieter and
  low-passed. A reverb from a generated impulse rings louder the more the listener is walled in,
  measured by 12 rays round the horizon out to 30 m. Distant sounds send more to it.
- **There's no ambient sound** (9): no wind, sea, birds or distant fighting.
  **Resolved** (14): wind grows with height and in the open. The sea is placed at the nearest
  water found in 16 directions out to 220 m and grows toward the shore. Birds grow with the trees
  within 40 m and go quiet for 20 s after a shot or blast nearby. Distant fighting is the real
  fighting: every shot on the island is heard, dulled by distance, delayed at the speed of sound,
  and past 60 m blended into a recording made at long range.
- **Surface detection for footsteps is rough** (9). It uses thresholds on height, slope and
  distance to an outpost, and doesn't match the painted terrain exactly.
  **Resolved** (14): `src/client/ground.ts` works out each terrain vertex's layer weights once,
  and both the renderer's paint and the footsteps use them. A footstep takes the strongest layer
  after blending the three vertices of the triangle underfoot. Tests check the normals match
  three.js's and the chosen layer is the strongest at each vertex.
- **No sliding scrape** (9). Slides are silent.
  **Resolved** (14): a gravel slide played for your own slides and other bodies' ones.
  **Moot** (after 14): sliding was removed from the game, and its sound with it.

- **Nobody has listened to the new sound** (14). This machine has no way to hear it. The
  recordings were chosen by title, description, rating and waveform, the cuts were placed from
  loudness envelopes, and the levels were set by rendering each sound offline in headless Chrome
  and measuring its peak and RMS. Mix, reverb amount and ambience levels need a listening pass.
- **The recordings are Freesound's previews** (14), 128 kbps MP3, not the original files, which
  need a Freesound account or API key to download. They're re-encoded once more to 64 kbps AAC.
- **Some recordings aren't what they stand for** (14). The suppressed shot sounds synthesized,
  the rifle and pistol reloads are mixes of other recordings, the bolt-action's shot is a .405
  Winchester lever-action, and concrete footsteps reuse the stone ones played 10% faster. Every
  gun shares the one suppressed shot, pitched per gun, and the bolt-action reloads with the rifle's
  magazine sound.
- **Only real fights make distant fighting** (14). In PvE the guards only fight you, so the
  island is quiet apart from your own fights.
- **Occlusion is three steps and only along lines** (14): clear, over the top or blocked. It
  doesn't bend round corners, the thickness of what's in between doesn't count, and a tree trunk
  exactly on the line muffles a sound as much as a building does.
- **The reverb is one generated room** (14), the same everywhere, only louder when walled in.
  It isn't placed in 3D, and a place with no roof yet (every building so far) rings like a room
  when its walls are close.
  **Improved** (15): the outposts' buildings have roofs, so inside them the reverb is right. The
  walled yards around them still ring like a room.
- **The sea's bearing is an average** (14) of the directions that found water at the nearest
  radius, so on a narrow point with sea on both sides it can seem to come from inland.
- **Far fights fill the voice pool** (14). A distant shot holds a voice through its delay and its
  2 s tail, so a long firefight far off keeps most of the 24 voices busy. When all are busy, the
  quietest sound is cut off (or the new one isn't played), so near sounds still win.
- **A slide from someone else always scrapes for the slide's full 0.9 s**, even if it ends early.
  **Moot** (after 14): sliding was removed.
- **Sounds arrive after the game starts** (14). The 854 kB file downloads in the background and
  isn't on the loading bar, and nothing plays until it's decoded (the game is playable
  meanwhile). If it fails, the game is silent apart from the beeps.
- **AAC playback was only checked in Chrome** (14): the packed offsets depend on the browser
  trimming the encoder's priming samples, which Chrome does exactly. Safari should (it's Apple's
  format) and Firefox should, but neither was tried.
- **The sound script needs a Mac** (14): it uses `afconvert` to decode and encode.

### Performance and loading
- **There's no loading indicator** (9). Until the assets arrive, the island quietly shows flat
  colours, and the swap is visible.
  **Resolved** (11): a loading screen in `index.html` shows before any script runs, with a progress bar over the
  downloads, and stays up until the assets are applied and their shaders compiled. After 8 s it
  offers to play in flat colours.
- **Assets are uncompressed** (9): JPEG textures instead of KTX2, and glTF without Draco or
  meshopt. The soldier is 2 MB and the sky 1.4 MB, about 6 MB in total.
  **Resolved** (11): the textures are two KTX2 array textures in Basis ETC1S (0.5 MB colour, 0.8 MB
  two-channel normals) that stay compressed on the GPU. The models are meshopt-compressed and
  quantized (soldier 0.5 MB, guns about 30 kB each), and the sky is halved to 512 × 256 (0.4 MB).
  That's about 2.3 MB in total.
- **Building the texture arrays can stall the page** (9). It uses canvas `getImageData` on the
  main thread at startup.
  **Resolved** (11): KTX2Loader transcodes the array textures in a Worker, and there's no canvas step
  any more.
- **The JavaScript bundle is over 500 kB** (9), with no code splitting. The build warns about
  it.
  **Resolved** (11): three.js is split into two chunks of its own (core 265 kB, WebGL renderer
  352 kB). The game's entry chunk is 120 kB, and the asset loaders (133 kB) load lazily. No chunk
  is over 500 kB, but the total loaded at start barely changed (see below).
- **The terrain is one full-resolution mesh**, with no LOD.
  **Resolved** (15): 5 × 5 tiles of 160 m, each with three levels (every vertex, every second
  and every fourth) switching at 230 m and 460 m from the tile's middle. The nearest level is
  exactly the collision triangles. Coarser tiles hang a 4 m skirt to hide cracks, and every
  level takes its normals and paint from the full-detail vertices. In the orbiting menu view the
  island draws 289k triangles instead of 689k.
- **Adaptive resolution is untested on slow hardware** (9) and could flip back and forth.
  **Resolved in part** (15): it did flip. A test with a simulated GPU that is too slow at full
  resolution and comfortably fast one step down saw 121 switches in 10 minutes. Now a step up
  that turns slow within 10 s isn't tried again for 30 s, then 60 s, and so on up to 10 minutes;
  the same test sees fewer than 12. It still hasn't run on real slow hardware.
- **Every positional sound creates its own panner node** (9), released on a timer. Heavy
  fights create a lot of them.
  **Resolved** (14): sounds out in the world take turns on a pool of 24 voices (gain, low-pass,
  HRTF panner and reverb send) built once when audio unlocks. Only the buffer source is new for
  each sound, as the Web Audio API requires.
- **The total JavaScript loaded at start barely changed** (11): about 740 kB minified (200 kB
  gzipped), now in four chunks that load in parallel. Splitting keeps three.js cached across
  game updates, but it doesn't shrink the download.
- **The Basis transcoder costs 527 kB** (11), or 249 kB gzipped. That eats much of what KTX2
  saves on the download. The real gains are GPU memory and no main-thread stall.
- **KTX2 textures are lossier than the JPEGs** (11): ETC1S, with two-channel normal maps. They
  were only compared by screenshot.
- **The sky is prefiltered through a 256 px cube** (11). Prefiltered straight from the halved
  image, it lit the island noticeably brighter, so it's first drawn into a cube the size the
  full image gave. The match was checked by screenshot only.
- **The loading bar is approximate** (11). It leaves out the script download (it sits at 0 until
  the scripts run), it guesses sizes that aren't known yet, and gzipped files count as done
  early, because their size is the compressed one.
- **The 5 s load target wasn't measured on a mid-range laptop** (11). Locally on an M3 Pro, the
  production build loads in 1.1 s cold and 0.4 s warm (3 MB transferred). The new build isn't on
  the live site until it's pushed.
- **Skipping the loading screen brings back the flat-colour swap** (11), which then shows
  mid-game when the assets land.
- **The game's entry chunk grew to 141 kB** (13), from 120 kB, with the body posing and the
  first-person arms. The soldier model grew by 4.5 kB for the death clip.
- **The entry chunk grew again, to 172 kB** (15), with the terrain tiles, water, ground cover,
  impostors and cascades. It all ships in the entry chunk rather than loading lazily.
- **The Buy Me a Coffee button blocks the page while it loads** (pause menu commit). Its
  script writes the button in place with `document.writeln`, so it has to be a plain blocking
  script in `index.html`. A slow buymeacoffee.com CDN holds up the rest of the page, and ad
  blockers that block it leave no button. A plain styled link would avoid both.
  **Resolved** (pause dashboard commit): the widget is replaced by a plain link styled like it,
  with no script and no class names that ad blockers match.
- **Esc can't always close the run dashboard straight back into the game** (run dashboard
  commit). Browsers don't count Esc as a user gesture, and Chrome refuses to re-lock the mouse
  for about a second after Esc freed it, so a refused lock left a "Click to resume" prompt anyway.
  **Resolved** (by removal): Esc no longer closes the dashboard; clicking anywhere does. Holding
  the dashboard on Tab, or claiming Esc with Keyboard Lock in fullscreen, would bring it back.

### Sharing and leaderboards
- **Scores in links can be faked** (10). With no backend, a link's `by` and `score` are plain
  query parameters, so anyone can edit them. They're a friendly challenge, not a record.
- **Leaderboards only hold your own runs, in one browser** (10). They're lost when site data is
  cleared, and they don't follow you to another device.
- **A link without a mode is taken as Mixed** (10), so an old `?world=` link with a score in it
  and no `mode` compares against Mixed runs.
  **Resolved** (12): a link without a mode keeps the mode you last played, and its score is the one
  to beat in whichever mode you pick (except the range). The menu then doesn't name a mode.
- **Names aren't filtered** (10). Locally only you and the bots see yours, but multiplayer will
  need filtering and length checks on the server.
- **"New island" only picks seeds up to 999,999** (10), to keep the numbers short. Typed
  `?world=` values still reach every seed.
- **The share button copies the link, and doesn't open the system share sheet** (10). Where the
  clipboard is blocked it falls back to a `prompt()` with the link.
- **GitHub Pages hosting isn't verified from here** (10). The deploy workflow has existed since
  chunk 0, but nobody has checked that Pages is enabled and that the live site's links work.
  **Resolved** (11): checked with a headless browser against
  https://richi8.github.io/onepointsix/. It served the latest pushed build (chunk 10's bundle
  hash) and the assets, and a `?world=4242&mode=pve&by=Tester&score=1234` link opened island
  #4242 in PvE with the challenge shown. Pages gzips `.hdr` and `.glb` and caches for 10 minutes.

### Death cam
- **Only the killer is replayed from inputs** (10). Everyone else is drawn from the snapshots the
  victim's client received, so they're a little behind, and bots out of sight may pop in.
- **The replay uses today's cover** (10). Panels that broke or were rebuilt during those seconds
  are drawn and collided as they are now, so a replayed killer can walk or shoot differently
  around them.
- **The killer's state can drift between keyframes** (10). The server changes a few things
  outside the commands (health, ammo from loot, dying). The replay re-syncs to a full state
  every 0.5 s, so errors are small and short-lived, but they're there.
  **Improved** (15): a new carry weight now writes a keyframe at once, since it changes how fast
  the player moves. Chunk 15's new outpost layouts had a bot take loot just before the end of
  the tape test, and its replay drifted 3 cm. Health and ammo still wait for the next key.
- **No HUD in the death cam** (10): there's no hit marker, killer health or ammo. The bolt
  scope overlay is the only thing shown besides the banner.
- **Death cam clips are big** (10): about 6 s of commands and keyframes as plain JSON, some tens
  of kB per death. That's fine through the Worker, but multiplayer should pack it.
- **Every player's inputs are taped all the time** (10), including guards far from anyone, just
  in case they kill someone. It's cheap, but it isn't free.
- **Deaths on the range get no death cam**, and neither does a self-kill with a grenade.
  Replays can't be shared yet either (see Future).

### Licensing
- **The Mixamo soldier's terms need checking** (9). Mixamo allows royalty-free use in games, but
  shipping the raw `soldier.glb` in a public repository and site may count as redistributing the
  asset itself. Replace it with a CC0 character (e.g. Quaternius) if in doubt.
  **Resolved** (11): replaced with Quaternius's CC0 "SWAT" character. Every shipped asset is now
  CC0.

### Code and testing
- **The texture layer list is duplicated** (9) in `scripts/fetch-assets.mjs` and
  `src/client/assets.ts`, and must be kept in step by hand.
  **Resolved** (11): `src/client/layers.ts` is now the one list (name, Poly Haven id, scale, tint).
  The game and the script both import it; Node strips the TypeScript types.
- **The client's rendering, animation and audio have no automated tests** (9). They were checked
  by screenshots only, and nobody has listened to the audio.
  Still true of the rendering and animation after chunk 13; the new snapshot fields they draw from
  (motion, action, suppressor, commander) are tested.
  After chunk 14, the ground paint, occlusion, enclosure, finding the sea, the voice pool and the
  packed sound list are tested. The audio engine itself was only checked in headless Chrome by a
  script outside the repo (offline renders of each sound, and a Mixed game checking the recordings
  decode and the ambience comes up), and still nobody has listened to it.
- **The death cam, menu, leaderboard UI and share button have no automated tests** (10). The
  tape replay, share links and leaderboard storage are tested; the rest was checked by
  screenshots in a headless browser only.
- **The menu's layout is only checked at desktop size** (10). It now scrolls when the window is
  too short, but it wasn't tried at small sizes.
  **Resolved** (12): screenshotted at 800 × 450, 640 × 400, 420 × 600 and 340 × 520. The title
  now shrinks with the window width, the menu keeps a side margin, and windows under 600 px tall
  get a tighter layout. Everything fits down to 800 × 450; at 640 × 400 only "What's new" is below
  the fold. It was checked on a static copy of the menu in headless Chrome, not the running game,
  because headless Chrome renders the game too slowly to screenshot.
- **Gun fitting uses hand-measured fractions** (9) in `src/client/guns.ts`, so a new model needs
  measuring again.
- **The asset script needs an Apple Silicon Mac** (11). It uses `sips` and `pkgutil`, and it
  downloads the arm64 build of the KTX tools unless `ktx` is on the PATH.
- **The loading screen and asset pipeline have no automated tests** (11). They were checked in
  a headless browser with software and Metal rendering, by screenshot and by timing.

- **Snapshots are bigger** (13): each player carries five more fields (motion, action and its
  progress, suppressor, commander). That's fine through the Worker, but multiplayer should pack
  them.
- **The pose viewer isn't part of the build or the tests** (13). `dev/pose.html` runs on the dev
  server only, and its screenshots were read by eye.
- **The world's new rendering has few automated tests** (15). The terrain tiles (exact heights
  up close, skirts), the wave height, adaptive resolution and the buildings (placement, bot paths
  into both rooms, walking through doorways, lintels falling, crates) are tested. The water
  shader, ground cover, impostors, cascades and indoor light were checked by screenshots only.
  In development, `?cam=x,y,z,tx,ty,tz` (or `?cam=o<outpost>,...` relative to an outpost) holds
  the menu camera for such screenshots.
- **Two tests had leaned on the old outpost layout** (15): the guard test put the intruder at a
  fixed spot, which now sits between two containers, and the mantle test picked a crate that now
  has another stacked on it. They now pick a spot the sentry can see, and an unstacked crate.
### Playtest and tuning
- **Nobody else has played it yet** (12). The chunk's goal, several full runs by other people with
  the average run between 3 and 10 minutes, still waits on real playtesters. Everything tuned so
  far comes from bots.
- **The run log stays in one browser** (12). There's no backend, so a playtester has to copy it
  from the F4 panel (Copy as JSON) and send it by hand. It keeps the last 200 runs.
- **Bot runs can't check run length** (12). An operator bot searches only 1–3 crates and leaves,
  so even its extracted runs last about 1:20. The bot playtest (`npm run playtest`) is good for
  comparing ways of playing and how often operators meet, not for how long a human run lasts.
- **Operator bots still die in most runs** (12). Over 6 islands × 30 min, 19% of their runs
  extract (up from 8%), 81% are killed, and guards do about two thirds of the killing, mostly
  sentries and outpost guards at 40–120 m. Making guards weaker helped bots but would also make
  PvE easier for humans, so guards were left alone until humans have played.
- **Most of the listed tuning wasn't changed** (12): guard count, bot skill numbers, weapon damage
  and recoil, extraction timings and loot values. In the bot playtest the rifle and bolt-action
  came out even (about 210 and 190 points per run), as did light and heavy carrying, so there was
  nothing to fix there without human data. Only the operator cap and operator bot behaviour were
  tuned.
- **The buildings haven't been tuned for** (15). In a 10-minute, 6-island bot playtest, operator
  bots got out of 19% of runs, against 18% before the buildings. The bolt-action's rate fell from
  22% to 11%, but on only about 70 runs each.
- **Operator bots now leave far-off enemies alone** (12). They fight guards only within 40 m, and
  other operators only within their gun's effective range, unless shot at in the last 10 s. That
  applies to human players too, so a bot you spot at long range won't open fire first.
- **The bot playtest leaves out runs still going when it stops** (12), so long runs are slightly
  undercounted. Bots get no contracts, so "contracts done" is always 0% there.
- **Wider drop-in spacing may fall back to anywhere** (12). Insertion points now keep 130 m from
  outposts and 100 m from other operators. When 60 random tries find nothing, the operator drops
  in at any land point, possibly next to an outpost. How often that happens wasn't measured.
- **The run log panel has no automated tests** (12). The records, summary and storage are tested;
  the F4 panel was only checked by typecheck.

## Future
- **Multiplayer**
  - Node server that reuses `server/`, with WebSocket first
  - Snapshot deltas, interpolation and lag compensation
  - Real matchmaking: the first instance that isn't full, or a new one, for each world
  - Bot fill that shrinks as humans join
  - Anonymous identity, basic anti-cheat, deployment
- **Transport upgrade:** WebTransport or WebRTC DataChannels (UDP-like), server-side visibility
  culling, server leaderboards
- **Replay links:** shareable through the server instead of as files (chunk 17 covers local
  replays)
- Global leaderboards and seasonal featured islands

## Decisions
- **No slide:** removed after chunk 14 at the user's request. Crouching while sprinting just
  crouches; `Motion` no longer has `'slide'`.
- **Weapons for the proof of concept:** assault rifle, pistol and bolt-action rifle
- **Capacity:** 8 operators (12 until chunk 12's playtest) and about 24 guards per game (tunable constant)
- **Backend:** none for now; the game is local only. Multiplayer is a future feature.
- **After the proof of concept:** chunks 11–18 polish and deepen the local game. Multiplayer
  stays in Future and comes after them.
- **No squads:** operators play free-for-all. Squads were dropped because the game's pitch
  ("beat my score") is a solo challenge, and revive would soften "die = score 0".
- **Platform:** desktop only (keyboard and mouse) in current Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Target
  is 60 fps on a mid-range laptop. No touch or mobile support for now.
- **Assets:** simple placeholder shapes until chunk 9. After that, only CC0 assets (Poly Haven,
  ambientCG, Quaternius). Chunk 9 also used a Mixamo soldier, which chunk 11 replaced to leave
  no licensing doubts.
- **Share links carry the sharer's score.** With no backend, leaderboards live in each browser,
  so the link encodes the world config plus the sharer's name and score as the target to beat.
- **Hosting:** a static site (e.g. GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages) is needed in chunk 10 so
  that links can be shared. It serves files only; there is still no game server.
- **Existing scaffold:** the uncommitted setup and `src/shared` world generator get reused and
  reviewed in chunks 0 and 1.
- **Testing:** Vitest for the shared simulation (determinism, movement, collision).
